# Hello, World!

## Project Directory

Rust doesn't care where the code files are but making a *projects* directory will help.

`$ mkdir ./projects`
`$ cd ./projects`
`$ mkdir hello_world`
`$ cd hello_world`

## Running script

Refer to `./projects/hello_world/main.rs`

Compile this script by `$ rustc main.rs`, then it creates an executable file, `main.exe`, which can be run by `$ ./main`

Compiling using `rustc` creates `.pdb` file as well, which is the debugging information file.
