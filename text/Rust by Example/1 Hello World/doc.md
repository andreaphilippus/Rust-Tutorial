# Hello World

Code is written as:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

- `fn main() { }` is where the code is primarily written and run
- `println!` is a macro that prints text to the console

Executable binary can be generated using the Rust compiler `rustc` as

```console
$ rustc 'rs_file_name'
```

It is best to avoid using spaces when naming `.rs` files.
